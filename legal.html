    <h3>Terms of Service</h3>

    <p>This Term of Service(“TOS”) constitute legal agreement between the licensee (“you”) and the Services provided by
      gamekudo.com.</p>

    <p>We prepared these ToS to help explain the terms that apply to your use of the Service.</p>

    <h3>1.Consent</h3>

    <p>By accessing or using our Service, you are agreeing to these ToS and concluding a legally binding contract with
      us. Do not access or use our Service if you are unwilling or unable to be bound by the ToS.</p>

    <h3>2. Privacy Policy</h3>

    <p>Our Privacy Policy, located at https://www.gamekudo.com/privacy.html, is part of and is governed by these ToS. By
      agreeing to these ToS, you agree to be bound by the terms of the Privacy Policy and agree that we may use
      information collected from you in accordance with its terms.</p>

    <h3>3. Notice Regarding Dispute Resolution</h3>

    <p>These ToS contain provisions that govern how claims you and we may have against each other are resolved,
      including an agreement and obligation to arbitrate disputes, which, subject to limited exceptions, will require
      you to submit claims you have against us to binding arbitration, unless you opt-out of arbitration as described
      below. If you do not opt-out of arbitration, you will only be permitted to pursue claims and seek relief
      (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) against us on an individual basis, not as part of any
      class or representative action or proceeding.</p>

    <h3>4. Updates to these ToS</h3>

    <p>
      We may modify these ToS from time to time. We will notify you of material changes in accordance with applicable
      laws. If you do not agree with the proposed changes, you should discontinue your use of the Service. If you
      continue using the Service after the new terms take effect, you will be bound by the modified ToS.
    </p>

    <h3>
      5. Obligations of the users
    </h3>

    <p>
      Users warrant that their content, reviews, self-presentations and inquiries, is consistent with the truth,
      permitted by law and unencumbered by third-party rights. The following content in particular is not permitted:
      Pestering (stalking), threats, insults, and the assertion of incorrect facts; content that may be detrimental to
      the development or education of children or young adults or put them at risk; content that infringes third-party
      copyrights, trademark rights, competition rights or rights to privacy; content that is racist or xenophobic,
      glorifies violence or is seditious, pornographic, degrading or immoral; content that may affect the health of
      individuals; chain letters, bulk messages with or without advertiser content (spamming); links to sites with such
      content; sweepstakes, contests, lottery draws or similar promotions; publication of private data (such as e-mail
      addresses); commercial advertising or references praising other competitor services.
    </p>

    <p>
      Gamekudo has the right to remove non-relevant content, especially content that does not relate to the specific
      thematic area of a Service (for example, political or religious topics in a range of games).
    </p>

    <p>
      Gamekudo reserves the right not to release content or to reverse the release thereof if there is concrete evidence
      to suggest that the content is in breach of statutory regulations, official prohibitions, the rights of third
      parties or public morality. The Service Provider is not, however, obliged to verify the content in advance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Gamekudo reserves the right to restrict the number or function of affiliate and similar advertising links placed
      by users and to prohibit the use of such links altogether.
    </p>

    <h3>
      6.Responsibility for content and information
    </h3>

    <p>
      Gamekudo is neither responsible nor liable for user-generated content or for linked content on other websites.
    </p>

    <p>
      Gamekudo wishes to point out that no claim is made regarding the accuracy, completeness, legal admissibility and
      absence of any rights of third parties of the content provided within the Service. Content is provided for fun and
      entertainment purposes only (e.g. Horoscopes, quizzes, tests, etc.), and as such, it comes with no guarantee of
      accuracy or usability of information and/or advice and/or results contained within. The content, tests, quizzes
      and horoscopes are non-scientific fun-content and can never replace medical diagnoses, scientific testing methods
      or professional advice. Such content is to be understood as non-binding information, recommendations and
      statements. In particular, no guarantee is offered that the content of the Service can be used in each country in
      which it is available. This restriction is due to the global nature of the Internet.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user in question, and not the Site, is responsible for user reviews, comments and ratings.
    </p>

    <h3>
      7. Non commercial usage by the Users
    </h3>

    <p>
      The Service is for personal use of individual Users only and may not be used in connection with any commercial
      endeavors. Organizations, companies, and/or businesses may not become members and should not use the Service or
      the Site for any purpose. Illegal and/or unauthorized uses of the Site, including collecting usernames and/or
      email addresses of members by electronic or other means for the purpose of sending unsolicited email and
      unauthorized framing of or linking to the Site will be investigated, and appropriate legal action will be taken,
      including without limitation, civil, criminal, and injunctive redress.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may use our Service within the limits of these ToS for yourself or your company. You are not entitled to rent,
      lend, lease, sell or make the Service capable of protection wholly or partially accessible in any technical form
      whatsoever to third parties for remuneration or free of charge without our explicit written approval. Sub-licences
      must not be issued.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may only use our Service via the input masks and interfaces provided. In particular, excessive use over and
      above normal levels of Service and interface usage intensity and frequency to be expected is prohibited (e.g. due
      to the use of software whose technical faults generate constant unnecessary access via our interfaces).
    </p>

    <p>
      You must not use our Service in any way that causes, or is likely to cause our Service or any access to it to be
      interrupted, damaged or impaired in any way, or for fraudulent purposes, or in connection with a criminal offence
      or other unlawful activity, or to cause annoyance, inconvenience or anxiety.
    </p>

    <p>
      We reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts or remove or edit content if you are in breach of
      applicable laws, these ToS or any other applicable terms and conditions, guidelines or policies.
    </p>
