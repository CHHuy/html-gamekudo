      Cookies
    </h3>

    <p>
      A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. We and some of our
      business partners (for example, advertisers) use cookies on our Website. These cookies track usage of the site for
      security, analytics and targeted advertising purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      We use the following type of cookies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Essential cookies: these cookies are essential to the provision of our Website.
      </li>
      <li>
        Analytics and performance cookies: these cookies help us collect statistical and analytical usage to help up
        analyze website usage.

    <h3>
      Advertising
    </h3>

    <p>
      We use the marketing and remarketing services (hereinafter referred to as the “Google Marketing Services”)
      provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountian View, CA 94043, USA.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Google Marketing Services enable us to display ads for and on our Websites and Service in a more targeted
      manner so that users are only shown ads which might actually be of interest to them. For this purpose, as soon as
      the user accesses our Websites, or other websites on which Google Marketing Services have been activated, Google
      immediately executes a re-marketing tag which is integrated into the Website. With the help of these tags, an
      individual cookie, is stored on the users’ device. The cookies can be set from various domains, including
      google.tv and doubleclick.net. This file keeps a record of which websites the user visits, what content he/she is
      interested in and which offers he/she has clicked on, as well as technical information about the browser and
      operating system, referring websites, time of access and other details about the use of the website content. The
      users’ IP address is also recorded, whereby we, within the context of Google Analytics, would like to point out
      that, within member states of the European Union or in other countries that are party to the Agreement on the
      European Economic Area, the IP address is truncated and only transmitted in its entirety to a Google server in the
      US and truncated there in exceptional cases. The IP address will not be linked with any of the user’s data from
      other services offered by Google. The aforementioned information can also be combined with equivalent information
      from other sources. If the user visits other websites afterwards, he/she can only be shown the ads that directly
      reflect his/her interests.
    </p>

    <p>
      Within the scope of Google Marketing Services, the users’ data is processed pseudonymously. This means that Google
      does not, for example, store and process the users’ name or e-mail address, instead processing the relevant data
      on basis of the cookies within pseudonymous user profiles. In other words, from Google’s point of view, the ads
      are managed and displayed for the cookie owner, regardless of who the cookie owner is, rather than for a
      specifically identified person. This shall not apply where the user has expressly permitted Google to process the
      data without this pseudonymization. The information collected about the users via “DoubleClick” shall be
      transmitted to Google and stored on Google’s servers in the US.
    </p>

    <p>
      On basis of Google Marketing Services, we integrate third-party “DoubleClick” ads. DoubleClick uses cookies that
      enable Google and its partner websites to run ads based on users visiting this or other websites. We also
      integrate third-party “AdSense” ads. AdSense uses cookies that enable Google and its partner websites to run ads
      based on users visiting this or other websites.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can find further information on Google’s use of data for marketing purposes at:
      https://www.google.tv/policies/technologies/ads, Google’s privacy policy can be viewed at
      https://www.google.tv/policies/privacy. If you wish to object to the collection of data by Google Marketing
      Services, you can use the settings and opt-out functions provided by Google: http://www.google.tv/ads/preferences.
    </p>

    <h3>
      USAGE OF GOOGLE ANALYTICS
    </h3>

    <p>
      We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies to gather
      information about the user’s interaction and engagement with the website. This information, including the user’s
      IP address, are used to evaluate the user’s interactions with the website, compile reports on website activity for
      website operators, and provide other services related to website activity and internet usage. Google Analytics
      will not associate the user’s IP address with any personally identifiable information.
    </p>

    <p>
      As with other cookies, the user may opt out of granting access to cookies by modifying the appropriate settings in
      the user’s web browser. However, this might compromise the user’s access to the full functionality of the We
      website. Continuous use of the We website will be considered the user’s express consent to the processing of their
      data by Google Analytics for the purposes stated above.
    </p>

    <p>
      For additional information, please refer to Google Analytics privacy policy
      https://www.google.tv/policies/privacy.
    </p>
